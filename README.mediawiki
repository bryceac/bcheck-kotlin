'''Description:''' Library written in Kotlin to help read and write <strong>bcheck</strong> files, 
which is the format used by <a href="https://github.com/bryceac/BCheckbook">BCheckbook</a>.

==Notes==

This library is currently a <abbr title="work in progress">WIP</abbr>.

Although the library structure is typical of a multiplatform library, this library currently <strong>only</strong> supports Kotlin Native and regular Kotlin projects 
(It is usable in Java projects, but nothing works).

The main priority is Kotlin JVM and it will remain that way, due to its intended purpose to be used in desktop apps running in a JVM and Android applications.
